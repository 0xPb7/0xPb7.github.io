### Other CSP Protections

### FAQs & Misconfigurations

### Stick to One CSP Header
- It is recommended to use a singular CSP header to avoid conflicts and maintain consistency. Multiple headers can lead to a highly restrictive policy.

### Send CSP Header in the HTTP Response
- Embed the CSP header in the HTTP response delivering the HTML content to effectively enforce the security policy.

### Avoid `script-src 'unsafe-inline'`
- Refrain from using `script-src 'unsafe-inline'` as it undermines most CSP protections, allowing overly permissive sources like `https://`, `*`, and `data`.

### Include (`default-src`, `object-src`, `base-uri`) with `none` or `self`
- Specify `default-src`, `object-src`, and `base-uri` in the CSP header with values set to either `none` or `self`. Preferably, use `none` and employ full paths to prevent loading potentially hazardous content.

### Utilize Full Paths to Prevent CDN Exploitation
- When specifying content sources, use full paths to thwart the loading of malicious content. Exercise caution with CDNs that allow free hosting of GitHub projects, as attackers can exploit this to upload and include malicious JavaScript, bypassing the CSP.

### Implement `report-sample` on `script-src/style-src`
- Ensure the usage of `report-sample` on the `script-src` and `style-src` directives in the CSP header. This facilitates accurate reporting of violations, enhancing the effectiveness of the security policy.

## Other ways to deploy CSP

- CSPv3 includes `'unsafe-dynamic'`, which is a propagating trust model. When used with `'nonce-abc123'` allows nonce'd scripts to load any resource.
